# Exploration of US Bikeshare Data

## Project Overview

**Description:**

This project involves using Python to explore data related to bike share systems in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Python code is utilized to import data and derive insightful answers by computing descriptive statistics. Additionally, a script is created to provide an interactive terminal experience by accepting raw input and presenting statistics.

**Requirements:**

To proceed with this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Time
- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas (Installed via Anaconda)

Additionally, you'll need:
- A text editor such as Sublime or Atom or VisualStudio Code.
- A terminal application (Terminal for Mac and Linux, or Cygwin for Windows).

**Files:**

The primary code file needed for this project is:
- **bikeshare.py**

Please note:
- The files **chicago.csv**, **new_york_city.csv**, and **washington.csv** are not uploaded to the remote repository due to their large size. These files are ignored using `.gitignore`.
